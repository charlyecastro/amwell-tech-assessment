## Implementation
Simple javascript application with a UI representing the execution of the task

1. Set up a custom CORS proxy following this [guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43262121/trying-to-use-fetch-and-pass-in-mode-no-cors) 
2. Built a simple UI using HTML/CSS.
3. Wrote logic in javascript primarily made up of 2 main functions.
    
    - fetchTextData(url) 
        -  takes in a url and fetches data from cors proxy + given url. Updates UI elements and stores the text response.
    - minThree(text) 
        -  Takes in the text response and returns an array of 3 min integers with no duplicates.
